            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
            <p>We process your personal data for the following purposes and on the respective legal bases:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><b>Account Management</b> (Performance of the Contract): To create and maintain your Account.</li>
                <li><b>Provision of Services</b> (Performance of the Contract): To deliver and improve the Platform and
                    related services.</li>
                <li><b>Payment Processing</b> (Performance of the Contract): To process transactions using our payment
                    provider.</li>
                <li><b>Marketing and Communication</b> (Consent/Legitimate Interest): To send you updates and

                <li><b>Analytics and Improvement</b> (Legitimate Interest): To analyze usage patterns and improve our
                    services.</li>
                <li><b>Legal Compliance</b> (Legal Obligation): To comply with our obligations under applicable laws.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Sharing, Transfers, and Processors</h2>
            <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><b>Service Providers</b>: Third parties that process data on our behalf, including Supabase, Google,
                    Stripe, and Plausible.</li>
                <li><b>Legal Authorities</b>: When required by law or necessary to protect our rights.</li>
                <li><b>Business Partners</b>: In aggregated or anonymized form for analytical and marketing purposes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your personal data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) only if appropriate
                safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses.</p>

            <h2>5. Account deletion and order history</h2>
            <p class="spaced-text">When you delete your Sway account, all personal data linked to your profile (user
                table, follows, preferences, images, etc.) is permanently erased. However, European and Belgian
                accounting law (Code des Sociétés et des Associations, Art. III.86 §1 and Royal Decree of 12/09/1983)
                obliges us to keep transactional records for <b>10 years</b>. To comply with both the law and
                Article 17 §3 b of the GDPR, we keep order records but <b>pseudonymise</b> any personal identifiers
                (e.g., your user ID and email are replaced with an irreversible hash). These records can no longer be
                linked back to you by Sway.</p>

            <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
                collected or as required by law. For example:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Accounting and tax-related data may be stored for at least 10 years.</li>
                <li>Other personal data may be retained for 5 years after your last interaction with the Platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>Under applicable data protection laws, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These
                include:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><b>Access</b>: Request a copy of your personal data.</li>
                <li><b>Rectification</b>: Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
                <li><b>Erasure</b>: Request deletion of your personal data under certain conditions.</li>
                <li><b>Restriction</b>: Request limitation of processing of your data.</li>
                <li><b>Data Portability</b>: Request transfer of your data in a structured, commonly used format.</li>
                <li><b>Objection</b>: Object to the processing of your personal data for specific purposes.</li>
                <li><b>Complaints</b>: File a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your data protection
                    rights have been violated.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our Platform. Cookies help
                us:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Remember your preferences.</li>
                <li>Analyze website traffic.</li>
                <li>Provide personalized content and advertisements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may
                affect your experience on our Platform.</p>

            <h2>9. Security</h2>
            <p class="spaced-text">We implement appropriate technical, organizational, and physical measures to
                safeguard your personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
                Despite these efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and we cannot
                guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="spaced-text">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our
                practices or legal obligations. If material changes are made, we will notify you via the Platform or by
                email at least 15 days before the changes take effect. For any update, deletion, or modification of your
                personal data, please contact us at the email below.</p>
